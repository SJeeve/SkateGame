Game Concept: 
2d pixel endless running side scrolling game, very similar to the Google Dino game / subway surfers.

The goal of the game is to skate and try not to hit the children in your way. You can avoid this by jumping. Hitting a child ( obstacle ) results in one life being lost out of 3 regardless of their shirt color. Losing 3 lives results in a Game Over. 

Kicking a child results in gaining 5 points. However, you can only hit children who wear yellow. 
Children with a red shirt and an X cannot be kicked. Kicking them results in losing 2 LIVES.
There will also be children with a grey shirt and a question mark so it is a mystery. 

The player must choose to either kick them or just jump over.

You can also collect an object ( currently thinking of coins or stars ) that you must jump to get to. However, this becomes tricky when you have to also consider obstacles in the way.


High scores will be recorded both for points and for the amount of time you last.

Business Analysis: 
We are thinking of making the game free to play on itch.io as a web game. Our target audience is people who are bored in school or work ( itch is unblocked on many work/school computers) or people who want to compete with friends, and only finish the demo, or first level; which is the skating rink. 

If enough people like the game, we can consider continuing development after the camp and finishing the other levels. We can also try to introduce the parry mechanism, which would bring more challenges to the game.

World Overview
The world will gradually get more ridiculous as the levels would go on, however, the game takes place when you are a employee at a roller rink and are recklessly skating on the CARPET, trying not to hit obstacles.

Art Direction 

A 2d pixel art style with bright colors.

Writing Direction

It doesn’t have a story.. It will if we can continue the levels but it’s unrealistic to get past the first level only.
